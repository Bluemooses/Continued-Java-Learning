Section 7 - Composition/Encapsulation/Polymorphism

In section 7 of the Java Masterclass by Tim Buchalka we learn about the principals of Object Oriented Programming [OOP] in Java.

Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are the main ideas behind Java's OOP.

*Abstraction: Objects, classes, and variables represent more complex underlying code & data.  We are able to handle complexity of tasks by splitting them up.

*Encapsulation: This practice allows us to keep fields within a class private, and providing access using public methods.  This protective barrier keeps data and code safe within the class.

*Inheritance: This allows new classes to inherit from other classes.  Using the extends keyword in Java.

Polymorphism: Java OOP allows the same word to mean different things in different contexts.  Method overloading/method overriding are specific to Java. 

Using these principals, we are able to write clean, abstracted code which is easier to read by a human.
